Hello my name is George. I consider myself a tech junkie, Avid movie lover, and a fan of good music. Oh did I mention that I like food.

A Little Bit about Myself
I graduated from college with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. Since then I landed a full time gig as a Software Engineer. I’m really into technology and I have been that way ever since I was a little kid. I like designing and building things so technology was the perfect outlet.

My ambition is to one day become a very good Front-End Developer or Interactive Designer I want to create nice looking websites and user interfaces.
